# Appendix 

This appendix pertains to the master thesis investigating the framing of facial recognition technology (FRT) in Danish news media from 2014 to 2024. 
The project used a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative frame analysis with classification models to extrapolate frames across the dataset. 

This appendix contains the code and scripts in addition to all documents of written consent for data collection, legal guidance from UBVA, frame definitions and processes. 

### Appendix 1: written permissions
Contains all documents of written permission from the media outlets + article agreements. 
Note that there are fewer documents than media outlets, as some outlets are owned by the same parent company.


### Appendix 2: UBVA
Contains the email correspondance with UBVA (Udvalget Til Beskyttelse Af Videnskabeligt Arbejde). 
These were further consulted in relation to the Copyright Act.

## Appendix 3: Webscrapers
Contains scripts for all 14 webscraper developed for extracting data for each for the media outlets having granted their permission. 

## Appendix 4: EDA
Contains the notebook for concatenating dataframes from each media outlet collected through each scraper, with initial cleaning before doing EDA.

## Appendix 5: Frame analysis
Contains the articles analysed during the frame analysis, labelled with various frame categories which were adjusted in each round until the final frames were identified. 
Definitions of final frames are in Appendix 6.

## Appendix 6: Operational frame definitions
Contains the operational definitions of the finalized frames. 

## Appendix 7: Classification models + Results
Contains the notebook for developing the classification models, predicting on the unlabelled data and conducting the results. 
This also contains information and details on various decisions made for the classification models, which could not be included in the thesis because of the character limits.
