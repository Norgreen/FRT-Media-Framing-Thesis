# Appendix 

This appendix pertains to the master thesis investigating the framing of facial recognition technology (FRT) in Danish news media from 2014 to 2024. 
The project used a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative frame analysis with classification models to extrapolate frames across the dataset. 

This appendix contains the code and scripts in addition to all documents of written consent for data collection, legal guidance from UBVA, frame definitions and processes. 

### Appendix 1: written permissions
Contains all documents of written permission from the media outlets + article agreements.
Note that there are fewer documents than media outlets, as some outlets are owned by the same parent company

### Appendix 2:

These were consulted, in addition to the consultation from the law firm DLA Piper, in relation to the copyright act. 

## Appendix 3: 
Contains scripts for all 14 webscraper developed for extracting data for each for the media outlets having granted their permission. 

## Appendix 4: 
Contains the notebook for concatting df's for each media outlet collected through each scraper, cleaning a bit before doing EDA. 

## Appendix 5: 
Contains the analyzed articles for the frame analysis with various labels which were developed and adjusted until the final frames were identified. Their definitions are in Appendix 6. 

## Appendix 6: 
Contains the operational definitions of the finalized frames. 

## Appendix 7: 
Contains the notebook for developing the classification models, predicting on the unlabelled data and conducting the results. This further contains information and details on various decisions taken, which the character limit of the thesis itself did not allow.
