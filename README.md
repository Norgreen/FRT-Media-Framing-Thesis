# FRT-Media-Framing-Thesis
Contains the code and scripts developed for my master's thesis, which investigates the framing of facial recognition technology (FRT) in Danish news media from 2014 to 2024. The project used a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative frame analysis with classification models to extrapolate frames across the dataset.
